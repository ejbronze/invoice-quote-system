# SantoSync

SantoSync is a premium quote-and-invoice workspace for modern trade teams. It combines document creation, client history, per-user preferences, admin tools, and branded export output in one polished operational dashboard.

Version: `1.0.0`

## Version 1.0.0 Summary

This version brings SantoSync into a more complete shared-workspace release. The app now supports server-backed shared workspace data for online use, invoice payment tracking, a three-state commercial snapshot card, stronger quote-versus-invoice card styling, compact overflow menus for document and line-item actions, a more refined pending-items cart flow, per-item image handling across the editor and cart, compact export thumbnails for imaged line items, admin issue inbox controls, stronger mobile modal behavior, and a cleaner branded dashboard shell. The quote/invoice workflow, cart behavior, document preview/export flow, and admin tooling all remain intact while the product identity and UI structure are more polished and easier to navigate.

## Brand System

The SantoSync brand is centralized in `js/brand.js`.

It currently defines:

- Brand name and tagline
- Developer and company credits
- Hero, onboarding, session, and about copy
- Primary brand colors
- Display and UI typography
- Reusable SVG logo rendering

Logo system:

- Wordmark: SantoSync logotype with product tagline
- Icon: Rounded square sync mark
- Monogram: Compact SVG mark used in splash, auth, navbar, and document branding
- Lockup: Icon plus name/tagline combination for brand surfaces

## Company Profile

Admins can manage a Company Profile inside the app. This profile is used in quote and invoice outputs.

Saved fields:

- Company name
- Tagline
- Address
- Email
- Phone
- Website
- Tax or registration ID

The Company Profile is stored in the shared workspace dataset when the API is available, and falls back to browser storage during local-only testing. It is used to populate:

- document preview headers
- print/PDF output
- company contact/footer identity in exports

## Roles

SantoSync uses a simple username/password role model inside the app:

- `Admin`: Can access settings, company profile, user management, client management, imports/exports, local test tools, issue inbox, and admin-only visibility such as creator attribution.
- `User`: Can sign in, create quotes/invoices, edit documents, save clients, and use the normal workspace without admin-only controls.

Default seeded admin account:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `Todos123`

When the app is online with the API available, user accounts are stored in the shared workspace dataset so they can be seen across devices. During local-only testing, they fall back to browser storage.

## Main Features

- Create, edit, delete, and convert quotes and invoices
- Daily reference numbering using the app’s document naming convention
- Reference numbering now resolves against the selected local document date and checks existing same-day refs before choosing the next sequence
- Admin-only user management
- Admin-only client record management
- Admin-only company profile management
- Per-user language preferences for English, Spanish, and French
- Client profiles that preserve bill-to and consignee details, including saved client switching in the editor
- Pending items cart with a dedicated create-item popup
- Pending items cart with visual item cards, a header action pill, document-insert controls, direct image upload from the cart list, and cart item image editing
- Line item image support inside the document editor with a visual add-image tile
- Compact overflow menus for line-item editor actions instead of persistent inline action buttons
- Issue reporting with optional screenshot upload
- Admin issue inbox with delete controls
- Local fallback mode when the API is unavailable
- JSON backup, restore, and selective export tools
- CSV template export and CSV import
- Calculator inside the document editor
- Compact dashboard actions and snapshot strip
- Document cards use stronger quote/invoice color separation plus text badges for `Draft` / `Logged`
- Invoice cards support `Paid` / `Unpaid` status badges and a menu action for payment tracking
- The top commercial snapshot value card cycles through `Pipeline Value`, `Amount Invoiced`, and `Income Received`
- Document cards use a compact overflow menu for actions such as edit, PDF preview, conversion, payment status, and delete
- Quote and invoice menus intentionally differ so payment actions appear only on invoices
- Mobile-tuned modal sizing for cart, issue reporting, and document preview/export flows
- Branded splash, auth, session-loading, about, and dashboard identity
- Branded print/PDF preview output with SantoSync company identity

## Document Output Rules

- Quotes use `For:` and `Reference No.`
- Quotes do not render consignee information in final output
- Invoices can render `Bill To` and `Consignee`
- PO numbers are omitted when blank or set to `N/A`
- Line item images are saved with the document and render as a compact export column when at least one item includes an uploaded image
- Printed/exported documents use the active Company Profile identity
- Internal-only pricing fields never appear in the exported document
- PDF preview opens first, and printing happens from that preview window
- Optional signature support is available at export time
- Optional company stamp overlay can be rendered near the signature as a visual export effect

## Local Storage vs Server Storage

Server-backed:

- Quotes and invoices through `/api/documents`
- Shared saved clients through `/api/clients`
  - saved client records persist `name`, `address`, `consigneeName`, and `consigneeAddress`
  - switching between saved clients restores the saved consignee fields instead of resetting them
- Shared workspace state through `/api/workspace`
  - user accounts and roles
  - issue inbox/reporting
  - company profile
  - pending items cart
  - cart item images and related shared cart metadata

Browser-local:

- Current signed-in session
- Local fallback copies of workspace data when the API is unavailable
- Local fallback test documents/clients when the API is unavailable

## Local Development

Install dependencies first:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app locally with the Vercel dev server so the `api/` routes are available:

```bash
npx vercel dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Notes:

- This repository currently uses `npx vercel dev` directly; there is no custom `dev:sandbox` script in `package.json`.
- When the API is unavailable, SantoSync automatically switches to browser-local fallback mode for documents, clients, and workspace data.
- For pure static UI-only checks, you can still use a static server, but API-backed features will not be available in that mode.

## Deployment Notes

- The app is a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend with Vercel serverless functions in `api/`
- Persistent server data depends on Vercel Blob configuration
- Shared workspace data now syncs online through `/api/workspace`
- The active signed-in session still remains browser-local by design
- A future backend auth layer would still be needed for stronger account security and password management

## Future Improvements

- Move roles and auth to a stronger shared backend
- Add a richer company profile page with logo upload and legal footer options
- Add document activity history and admin reporting
- Add configurable exchange rates and tax profiles
- Add reusable brand themes per company/account
