## Brand System

The SantoSync brand is centralized in `js/brand.js`.

It currently defines:

- Brand name and tagline
- Developer and company credits
- Hero, onboarding, session, and about copy
- Primary brand colors
- Display and UI typography
- Reusable SVG logo rendering

Logo system:

- Wordmark: SantoSync logotype with product tagline
- Icon: Rounded square sync mark
- Monogram: Compact SVG mark used in splash, auth, navbar, and document branding
- Lockup: Icon plus name/tagline combination for brand surfaces

## Company Profile

Admins can manage a Company Profile inside the app. This profile is used in quote and invoice outputs.

Saved fields:

- Company name
- Tagline
- Address
- Email
- Phone
- Website
- Tax or registration ID

The Company Profile is stored in the shared workspace dataset when the API is available, and falls back to browser storage during local-only testing. It is used to populate:

- document preview headers
- print/PDF output
- company contact/footer identity in exports

## Roles

SantoSync uses a simple username/password role model inside the app:

- `Admin`: Can access settings, company profile, user management, client management, imports/exports, local test tools, issue inbox, and admin-only visibility such as creator attribution.
- `User`: Can sign in, create quotes/invoices, edit documents, save clients, and use the normal workspace without admin-only controls.

Default seeded admin account:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `Todos123`

When the app is online with the API available, user accounts are stored in the shared workspace dataset so they can be seen across devices. During local-only testing, they fall back to browser storage.

## Main Features

- Create, edit, delete, and convert quotes and invoices
- Daily reference numbering using the app’s document naming convention
- Admin-only user management
- Admin-only client record management
- Admin-only company profile management
- Per-user language preferences for English, Spanish, and French
- Client profiles that also preserve consignee name and address
- Pending items cart with a dedicated create-item popup
- Pending items cart with visual item cards, a header action pill, and document-insert controls
- Issue reporting with optional screenshot upload
- Admin issue inbox with delete controls
- Local fallback mode when the API is unavailable
- JSON backup, restore, and selective export tools
- CSV template export and CSV import
- Calculator inside the document editor
- Compact dashboard actions and snapshot strip
- Mobile-tuned modal sizing for cart, issue reporting, and document preview/export flows
- Branded splash, auth, session-loading, about, and dashboard identity
- Branded print/PDF preview output with SantoSync company identity

## Document Output Rules

- Quotes use `For:` and `Reference No.`
- Quotes do not render consignee information in final output
- Invoices can render `Bill To` and `Consignee`
- PO numbers are omitted when blank or set to `N/A`
- Printed/exported documents use the active Company Profile identity
- Internal-only pricing fields never appear in the exported document
- PDF preview opens first, and printing happens from that preview window

## Local Storage vs Server Storage

Server-backed:

- Quotes and invoices through `/api/documents`
- Shared saved clients through `/api/clients`
- Shared workspace state through `/api/workspace`
  - user accounts and roles
  - issue inbox/reporting
  - company profile
  - pending items cart

Browser-local:

- Current signed-in session
- Local fallback copies of workspace data when the API is unavailable
- Local fallback test documents/clients when the API is unavailable

## Local Development

Run a static local server for safe UI testing:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

When the API is unavailable, SantoSync automatically switches to browser-local test mode.

## Deployment Notes

- The app is a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend with Vercel serverless functions in `api/`
- Persistent server data depends on Vercel Blob configuration
- Shared workspace data now syncs online through `/api/workspace`
- The active signed-in session still remains browser-local by design
- A future backend auth layer would still be needed for stronger account security and password management

## Future Improvements

- Move roles and auth to a stronger shared backend
- Add a richer company profile page with logo upload and legal footer options
- Add document activity history and admin reporting
- Add configurable exchange rates and tax profiles
- Add reusable brand themes per company/account
